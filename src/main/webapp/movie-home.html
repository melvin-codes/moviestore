            <h4 class="text-white">What is a movie?</h4>
            <p>Movies, also known as films, are a type of visual communication
                which uses moving pictures and sound to tell stories or teach people
                something. People in every part of the world watch movies as a type
                of entertainment, a way to have fun. For some people, fun movies can
                mean movies that make them laugh, while for others it can mean movies
                that make them cry, or feel afraid. Most movies are made so that they
                can be shown on big screens at movie theatres and at home.

            <h4 class="pt-2 text-white">7 Seriously cool ways to make family movie night special</h4>
            <p> Not gonna lie, watching movies is one of my all-time favorite things to do.
                It's such a great way to escape and laugh, or cry, or be scared out of my mind.
                And family movie nights are a super special time to chill out and hang with
                the fam. My son's still a bit too young for it, but as my daughter
                gets older, I'm having a blast showing her some of my favorite movies.</p>
